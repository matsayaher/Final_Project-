  <p>The Vignette Collevction began in 2017 in Central Wisconsin. This business began with two sisters whose passion for photography and creative innovation blossomed. Both founders, Matsaya and Whitney had their businesses, but later decided to join as one. It's always more fun with more people; the more the merrier!</p>

        <p class="pmeetus">Hi there! My name is Matsaya Her. I am a current student at UW-Stevens Point in Central Wisconsin. I received my first Canon camera from my sister in middle school and I have grown to love and appreciate the arts of photography. As one of the photogaphers, I am dedicated to capture the best moments of my clients and I strive to make them as comfortable and satisfied as possible!</p>
    
     <h5 class="hmeetus">Whitney Yang</h5>
        <p class="pmeetus">Greetings, I am Whitney Yang! I am a stay-at-home mom who graduated from UW-Stevens Point with a bachelors in Web and Digital Media Development! I worked at Skyward as a software engineer, but after having my first child, I wanted to be a stay at home mom. Now I have more time to tend to my children and more time to spend on my photography business as a whole. We are so excited to work with you!</p>
